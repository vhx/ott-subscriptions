# FeedbacK: These queries are not very efficient; Look into ActiveRecord


# Notes:
# https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html
# Doing Subscription.all retrieves the entire table
# and then stores this in memory which is too much
# Active records has methods to use instead
#

    # return results and paginate
